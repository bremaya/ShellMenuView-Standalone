# ShellMenuView Standalone

Disable / enable context menu items of Explorer.

ShellMenuView (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shell_menu_view.html) is a small utility that displays the list of static menu items that appeared in the context menu when you right-click a file/folder on Windows Explorer, and allows you to easily disable unwanted menu items.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with NirSoft\Nir Sofer (https://www.nirsoft.net/) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with ShellMenuView v1.41.
